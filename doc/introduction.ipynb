    "- A dataset-oriented API for examining :ref:`relationships <scatter_bubbles>` between :ref:`multiple variables <faceted_lineplot>`\n",
    "- Specialized support for using categorical variables to show :ref:`observations <jitter_stripplot>` or :ref:`aggregate statistics <pointplot_anova>` \n",
    "- Options for visualizing :ref:`univariate <stacked_histogram>` or :ref:`bivariate <joint_kde>` distributions and for :ref:`comparing <horizontal_boxplot>` them between subsets of data\n",
    "- Automatic estimation and plotting of :ref:`linear regression <anscombes_quartet>` models for different kinds :ref:`dependent <logistic_regression>` variables\n",
    "- Convenient views onto the overall :ref:`structure <scatterplot_matrix>` of complex datasets\n",
    "- High-level abstractions for structuring :ref:`multi-plot grids <many_facets>` that let you easily build :ref:`complex <pair_grid_with_kde>` visualizations\n",
